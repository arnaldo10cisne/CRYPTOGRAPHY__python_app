    Program created by Arnaldo Cisneros. I got inspired to develop it because it was a test that was given
    to me in a technical interview. I wasn't sure how to do it back then, but every time we are faced with
    a problem that we don't know how to solve, but do it anyway, we become a better person.
    
    This program can encrypt and decrypt arrays of English words.
    
    The ENCRYPTION process is very straightforward. We just need to change each of the letters in the array
    to a new one, creating an encryption key in the process to make the changes consistent.
    
    This way, if we have the following array of words:
    --> ['selfish','fish','fishing','jellyfish'] <--
    We can change each of the letters for another random symbol, creating the following encryption guide: 
    
    ('->' = 'becomes')
    | S -> M | E -> W | L -> P | F -> R |
    | I -> N | H -> F | N -> Q | G -> K |
             | J -> $ | Y -> # |
    
    At the end of the encryption process, we'll have the following encrypted array, ready to be decrypted:
    --> ['mwprnmf','rnmf','rnmfnqk','$wpp#rnmf'] <--

    The DECRYPTION process is more complex, and the algorithm used here is a simple trial and error with a
    recursive function. First, we need to separate all the valid english words in number of characters. 
    This way, we'll have a structure similar to this one:

    1 : ['a','e','i','o','u', ...]
    2 : ['me','he','it','we','us', ...]
    3 : ['him','you','red','win','boy', ...]
    4 : ['girl','ways','lego','cold','moon', ...]
    ....

    Then, we'll go over each of the encrypted words and assign them to the ones that have the same amount of 
    characters, creating a possible encryption guide during the process.  
    If we run out of possible matches on one word, we go back to the previous one, and find the next possible 
    result, changing the encryption guide until we have one that gives good results on all the encrypted words.

    The word API used to validate words and obtain random ones is: https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com
